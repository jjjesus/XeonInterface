\subsection{SATA (local boot flash)}
\label{section:sata}

This SATA interface is to the Linux boot image and initial ram disk.  The K3 application does not use this interface. An entry in \texttt{/etc/services.d} in the initial ram disk starts a K3 application called \texttt{CSWMain} which is a shim program that loads the K3 application from the External SSD (Section \ref{section:sata2}).
