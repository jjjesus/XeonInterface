\section{Interfaces}

Interfaces are depicted in Figure \ref{fig:inteface}.  Details of each
interface are provided in subsections below.

\subsection{SATA (local boot flash)}
\label{section:sata}

This SATA interface is to the Linux boot image and initial ram disk.
The K3 application does not use this interface.
The only tie between the Linux boot image and the K3 application is 
an entry in the initial ram disk in \texttt{/etc/services.d} that
starts a K3 executable called \texttt{CSWMain}.
\texttt{CSWMain} is a shim program that loads configuration files
and libraries from the External SSD (Section \ref{section:sata2}) and
launches them.

\subsection{SATA (External SSD)}
\label{section:sata2}

An External Solid-State Drive (SSD) is the Mercury Systems TRRUST-Stor SSD MSD512 Self-Encrypted Drive mounted in a 3-U carrier in Slot 8 of the VPX chassis.  The Xeon-D has a SATA connection to this SSD through the VPX backplane and uses the serial port interface through the SCIM (Section \ref{section:sata2}) to send key information to unlock the SSD.

\textcolor{red}{\textbf{Question for Nick:} Do you think we need to
continue using a Self-Encrypted Drive like the Mercury TRRUST-Stor?}
